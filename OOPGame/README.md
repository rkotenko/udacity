===============================

This is a simple frogger-like game.  The engine that draws the screen, the images, and some basic scaffolding  was provided by the course.  It was my task to implement how the enemies and the character moves.  Enemies move at varying speeds on specific rows.  Player can move any direction, not allowed to move off map.  When player reaches water, they "win" and get reset.  If they touch an enemy they are reset.  I also used mocha, sinon, and chai for testing because testing is good and testing is pure.
