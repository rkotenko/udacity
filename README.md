udacity
=======

There are a lot of interesting courses on Udacity.  Each course has one or more projects that are completed for it.  So, while I will often be very familiar with concepts of the courses, I like the idea of building something concrete. My job does not always give me the opportunity to put the things I have learned into practice.  I am hoping the courses on Udacity will aid in this deficiency.  It will certainly help solidify them in my mind for the time when I will get to use them.  Storing them here will be good for my own personal review and for sharing with others if that need arises.
